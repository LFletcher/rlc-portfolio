	 <h3>My Creative Process </h3>
	 </div>
	 <div class="accordion-content cf">
	 <p>Step 1. Research. Explore. Go to art exhibits. Look at things, really look at things. 
     
     Step 2. Buy a sketch book. If you have never taken a drawing it is TOTALLY OK! You use your sketch book to jot down your ideas, to make a rough sketch of what you have on your mind. Anytime I get an assignment (this also inclides web design) the first thing I do is pull out my sketch book and lay things out. Dont make just one sketch for one idea you have, push yourself and draw more, even if at the moment you dont think they are that cool. The purpose of this is to get your creative mojo going.
     
     Step 3. Select some of your best ideas and sketches and get feedback from your professor or client (the person grading you or giving you money) Having their input will guide you in the right direction and you will know what you need to work on more OR if what you have done thus far is not what they had in mind you can start over without having invested too much time on something they dont like.
     
     Step 4. Have an awesome music list.

	 <h3>Color Theory </h3>
	 </div>
	 <div class="accordion-content cf">
	 <p> In the visual arts, color theory is a body of practical guidance to color mixing and the visual effects of a specific color combination. There are also definitions (or categories) of colors based on the color wheel: primary color, secondary color and tertiary color.
     
     I have not picked a color scheme yet. I am thinking orange and green as accent colors and black and white.

	 <h3>Typography </h3>
	 </div>
	 <div class="accordion-content cf">
	 <p> Typography is the art and technique of arranging type to make written language readable and appealing. The arrangement of type involves selecting typefaces, point size, line length, line-spacing (leading), letter-spacing (tracking), and adjusting the space within letters pairs (kerning). Type design is a closely related craft, sometimes considered part of typography; most typographers do not design typefaces, and some type designers do not consider themselves typographers.
     
     Most people have a “go- to” font(helvetica for me) and the chosen font can say a lot about the person. Whether you’re fun, traditional, experimental or boring, there’s a font for everything. Deciding on the correct font can come down to a real science, typography is a huge factor in design. Choosing the correct font will help convey your ideas, and will definitely help for a better design!
